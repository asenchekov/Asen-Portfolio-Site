                <p>My employment history until now was in the hospitality work area as a chef, 
                    I hope that doesn't confuse you. I have a passion for coding since I was young, 
                    used to play around with MS-DOS, QBASIC and PASCAL but took a different path 
                    and profession. I've been always the guy helping my friends fixing their computers
                    and reinstalling operating systems and such. Recently decided to make a change 
                    and started studying for a web developer, with the dream of making it my 
                    full-time job. Since I started learning to code I keep telling myself that 
                    I should've started a long time ago. I've achieved certification for a 
                    Beginner Web Developer and CIW certification for Advanced HTML5 and CSS3 
                    specialist, and recently started a Certification program for Introduction 
                    to Computer Science at HarvardX by EdX platform. Along with these lessons 
                    I have few free courses finished at codecademy.com for Javascript and React.js. 
                    At my current position I'm working on Meteor.js framework based project. 
                    Gaining experience writing ES6 style code, working with MongoDB and various 
                    tools for it. Also learned to test http requests with ngrok. I am an amateur 
                    photographer and also like making logos using photoshop and illustrator.</p>
